abstract = {{BACKGROUND: A review of the barriers to mosquito net use in malaria-endemic countries has yet to be presented in the published literature despite considerable research interest in this area. This paper partly addresses this gap by reviewing one component of the evidence base; namely, published research pertaining to self-reported reasons for not using a mosquito net among net 'owning' individuals. It was anticipated that the review findings would potentially inform an intervention or range of interventions best suited to promoting greater net use amongst this group. METHOD: Studies were sought via a search of the Medline database. The key inclusion criteria were: that study participants could be identified as owning a mosquito net or having a mosquito net available for use; that these participants on one or more occasions were identified or self-reported as not using the mosquito net; and that reasons for not using the mosquito net were reported. Studies meeting these criteria were included irrespective of mosquito net type. RESULTS: A total of 22 studies met the inclusion criteria. Discomfort, primarily due to heat, and perceived (low) mosquito density were the most widely identified reason for non-use. Social factors, such as sleeping elsewhere, or not sleeping at all, were also reported across studies as were technical factors related to mosquito net use (i.e. not being able to hang a mosquito net or finding it inconvenient to hang) and the temporary unavailability of a normally available mosquito net (primarily due to someone else using it). However, confidence in the reported findings was substantially undermined by a range of methodological limitations and a dearth of dedicated research investigation. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this review should be considered highly tentative until such time as greater quantities of dedicated, well-designed and reported studies are available in the published literature. The current evidence-base is not sufficient in scope or quality to reliably inform mosquito net promoting interventions or campaigns targeted at individuals who own, but do not (reliably) use, mosquito nets.}},

abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Despite recent advances in the fight against the disease, malaria remains a serious threat to the health and well-being of populations in endemic countries. The use of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLIN) reduces contact between the vector and humans, thereby reducing transmission of the disease. LLINs have become an essential component of malaria control programmes worldwide.METHODS: The Culture of Net Use study used qualitative and quantitative methods in a longitudinal and iterative design over two phases, in order to capture changes in net use over a year and a half period and covering both dry and rainy seasons. Data were collected from a total of 56 households in eight regions to understand variations due to geographical, cultural, and universal coverage differences. At the time of the data collection, the universal coverage campaign had been completed in six of the eight regions (Dakar and Thies excluded).RESULTS: Perceived barriers to use were primarily related to the characteristics of the net itself, include shape, insecticide, and a variety of minority responses, such as perceived lack of mosquito density and being unaccustomed to using nets. Insecticide-related complaints found that insecticide did not present a significant barrier to use, but was cited as a nuisance. Feelings of suffocation continued to be the most commonly cited nuisance. Respondents who favoured the use of insecticide on nets appeared to be more aware of the health and malaria prevention benefits of the insecticide than those who perceived it negatively.CONCLUSION: Despite prior evidence that barriers such as heat, shape, insecticide and perceived mosquito density contribute to non-use of LLINs in other countries, this study has shown that these factors are considered more as nuisances and that they do not consistently prevent the use of nets among respondents in Senegal. Of those who cited inconveniences with their nets, few were moved to stop using a net. Respondents from this study overcame these barriers and continue to value the importance of nets}},

abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Despite increased access and ownership, barriers to insecticide-treated bed net (ITN) use persist. While barriers within the home have been well documented, the challenges to net use when sleeping away from home remain relatively unexplored. This study examines common situations in which people sleep away from home and the barriers to ITN use in those situations.METHODS: To explore these issues, a group of researchers conducted 28 in-depth interviews and four focus groups amongst adults from net-owning households in four Ugandan districts.RESULTS: In addition to sleeping outside during hot season, participants identified social events, livelihood activities, and times of difficulty as circumstances in which large numbers of people sleep away from home. Associated challenges to ITN use included social barriers such as fear of appearing proud, logistical barriers such as not having a place to hang a net, and resource limitations such as not having an extra net with which to travel. Social disapproval emerged as an important barrier to ITN use in public settings.CONCLUSIONS: Unique barriers to ITN use exist when people spend the night away from home. It is essential to identify and address these barriers in order to reduce malaria exposure in such situations. For events like funerals or religious "crusades" where large numbers of people sleep away from home, alternative approaches, such as spatial repellents may be more appropriate than ITNs. Additional research is required to identify the acceptability and feasibility of alternative prevention strategies in situations where ITNs are unlikely to be effective}},

abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Study objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of commonly used post-campaign hang-up visits on the hanging and use of campaign nets. METHODS: A cluster-randomized trial was carried out in Uganda following an ITN distribution campaign. Five clusters (parishes, consisting of 11 villages each) were randomly selected for each of the three study arms with between 7,534 and 9,401 households per arm. Arm 1 received one hang-up visit, while Arm 2 received two visits by volunteers four and seven months after the campaign. Visits consisted of assistance hanging the net and education on net use. The control arm was only exposed to messages during the campaign itself. Three cross-sectional surveys with a two-stage cluster sampling design, representative of the study populations, were carried out to capture the two key outcome variables of net hanging and ITN use. Sample size was calculated to detect at least a 15 percentage-points change in net use, and was 1811 at endline. The analysis used an intention-to-treat approach. FINDINGS: Both hanging and use of ITN increased during follow-up in a similar way in all three study arms. The proportion of the population using an ITN the previous night was 64.0\% (95\% CI 60.8, 67.2), for one additional visit, 68.2\% (63.8, 72.2) for two visits and 64.0\% (59.4, 68.5) for the control. The proportion of households with all campaign nets hanging increased from 55.7\% to 72.5\% at endline (p<0.0005 for trend), with no difference between study arms. Financial cost per household visited was estimated as USD 2.33 for the first visit and USD 2.24 for the second. CONCLUSIONS: Behavior change communication provided during the campaign or through other channels was sufficient to induce high levels of net hanging and use and additional "hang-up" activities were not cost-effective}},

Using data from multiple sources, we generate high-resolution maps of ITN access, use, and nets-per-capita annually from 2000 to 2020 across the 40 highest-burden African countries. Our findings support several existing hypotheses: that use is high among those with access, that nets are discarded more quickly than official policy presumes, and that effectively distributing nets grows more difficult as coverage increases. The primary driving factors behind these findings are most likely strong cultural and social messaging around the importance of net use, low physical net durability, and a mixture of inherent commodity distribution challenges and less-than-optimal net allocation policies, respectively. These results can inform both policy decisions and downstream malaria analyses. Insecticide treated nets (ITNs) are an important part of malaria control in Africa and WHO targets aim for 80\% coverage. This study estimates the spatio-temporal access and use of ITNs in Africa from 2000-2020, and shows that both metrics have improved over time but access remains below WHO targets.}},

abstract = {{BACKGROUND:The use of insecticide-treated nets (ITN) is an important tool in the Roll Back Malaria (RBM) strategy. For ITNs to be effective they need to be used correctly. Previous studies have shown that many factors, such as wealth, access to health care, education, ethnicity and gender, determine the ownership and use of ITNs. Some studies showed that free distribution and public awareness campaigns increased the rate of use. However, there have been no evaluations of the short- and long-term impact of such motivation campaigns. A study carried out in a malaria endemic area in south-western Burkina Faso indicated that this increased use declined after several months. The reasons were a combination of the community representation of malaria, the perception of the effectiveness and usefulness of ITNs and also the manner in which households are organized by day and by night. 
METHODS:PermaNet 2.0 and Olyset were distributed in 455 compounds at the beginning of the rainy season. The community was educated on the effectiveness of nets in reducing malaria and on how to use them. To assess motivation, qualitative tools were used: one hundred people were interviewed, two hundred houses were observed directly and two houses were monitored monthly throughout one year.

RESULTS:The motivation for the use of bednets decreased after less than a year. Inhabitants' conception of malaria and the inconvenience of using bednets in small houses were the major reasons. Acceptance that ITNs were useful in reducing malaria was moderated by the fact that mosquitoes were considered to be only one of several factors which caused malaria. The appropriate and routine use of ITNs was adversely affected by the functional organization of the houses, which changed as between day and night. Bednets were not used when the perceived benefits of reduction in mosquito nuisance and of malaria were considered not to be worth the inconvenience of daily use.

CONCLUSION:In order to bridge the gap between possession and use of bednets, concerted efforts are required to change behaviour by providing accurate information, most particularly by convincing people that mosquitoes are the only source of malaria, whilst recognising that there are other diseases with similar symptoms, caused in other ways. The medical message must underline the seriousness of malaria and the presence of the malaria vector in the dry season as well as the wet, in order to encourage the use of bednets whenever transmission can occur. Communities would benefit from impregnated bednets and other vector control measures being better adapted to their homes, thus reducing the inconvenience of their use.}},

Understanding decision-making around net allocation in households with too few nets is essential to ensuring protection of the most vulnerable.

METHODS:Data collection consisted of eight focus group discussions, twelve in-depth interviews, and a structured questionnaire to inventory 107 sleeping spaces in 28 households.

RESULTS:In focus group discussions and in-depth interviews, participants almost unanimously stated that pregnant women, infants, and young children should be prioritized when allocating nets. However, sleeping space surveys reveal that heads of household sometimes receive priority over children less than five years of age when households have too few nets to cover all members.

CONCLUSIONS:When asked directly, most net owners highlight the importance of allocating nets to the most biologically vulnerable household members. This is consistent with malaria behaviour change and health education messages. In actual allocation, however, factors other than biological vulnerability may influence who does and does not receive a net.}},

While the insecticidal durability of LLINs is around 3 years, nets are commonly discarded 2 years post distribution. This study investigated the factors associated with the decision of users to discard LLINs. A mixed-method sequential explanatory approach using a structured questionnaire followed by focus group discussions (FGDs) to collect information on experiences, views, reasons, how and when LLINs are discarded. Out of 6,526 households that responded to the questionnaire of LLINs durability trial, 160 households were randomly selected from the households in four villages in Bagamoyo Tanzania for FGDs but only 155 households participated in the FGDs. Five of the household representatives couldn’t participate due to unexpected circumstances. A total of sixteen FGDs each comprising of 8–10 adults were conducted; older women (40–60 years), older men (40–60 years), younger women (18–39 years), younger men (18–39 years). During the FGDs, participants visually inspected seven samples of LLINs that were “too-torn” based on Proportionate Hole Index recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines on LLIN testing, the nets were brought to the discussion and participants had to determine if such LLINs were to be kept or discarded. The study assessed responses from the same participants that attended FGD and also responded to the structured questionnaire, 117 participants fulfilled the criteria, thus data from only 117 participants are analysed in this study. In FGDs, integrity of LLIN influenced the decision to discard or keep a net. Those of older age, women, and householders with lower income were more likely to classify a WHO “too-torn” net as “good”. The common methods used to discard LLINs were burning and burying. The findings were seen in the quantitative analysis. For every additional hole, the odds of discarding a WHO “too-torn” LLIN increased [OR = 1.05 (95\%CI (1.04–1.07)), p < 0.001]. Younger age group [OR = 4.97 (95\%CI (3.25–7.32)), p < 0.001], male-headed households [OR = 6.85 (95\%CI (4.44 –10.59)), p < 0.001], and wealthy households [OR = 3.88 (95\%CI (2.33–6.46)), p < 0.001] were more likely to discard LLINs. Integrity of LLIN was the main determinant for discarding or keeping LLINs and the decision to discard the net is associated with socioeconomic status of the household, and the age and gender of respondents. WHO “too torn” nets are encouraged to be used instead of none until replacement, and disposal of nets should be based on recommendation.

A functional LLIN is one that is present, is in good physical condition, and remains insecticidal, thereby providing protection against vector-borne diseases through preventing bites and killing disease vectors.

Therefore, institutional buyers often assume that prequalified LLINs are functionally identical with a 3-year lifespan. We measured the lifespans of 3 LLIN products, and calculated their cost per year of functional life, to demonstrate the economic and public health importance of procuring the most cost-effective LLIN product based on its lifespan. A randomised double-blinded trial of 3 pyrethroid LLIN products (10,571 nets in total) was conducted at 3 follow-up points: 10 months (August–October 2014), 22 months (August–October 2015), and 36 months (October–December 2016) among 3,393 households in Tanzania using WHO-recommended methods.

Secondary outcomes were (1) bioefficacy and chemical content (residual insecticidal activity) and (2) protective efficacy for volunteers sleeping under the LLINs (bite reduction and mosquitoes killed). Median LLIN functional survival was significantly different between the 3 net products (p = 0.001): 2.0 years (95\% CI 1.7–2.3) for Olyset, 2.5 years (95\% CI 2.2–2.8) for PermaNet 2.0 (hazard ratio [HR] 0.73 [95\% CI 0.64–0.85], p = 0.001), and 2.6 years (95\% CI 2.3–2.8) for NetProtect (HR = 0.70 [95\% CI 0.62–0.77], p < 0.001). Functional survival was affected by accumulation of holes, leading to users discarding nets. Protective efficacy also significantly differed between products as they aged. Equivalent annual cost varied between US\$1.2 (95\% CI \$1.1–\$1.4) and US\$1.5 (95\% CI \$1.3–\$1.7), assuming that each net was priced identically at US\$3. The 2 longer-lived nets (PermaNet and NetProtect) were 20\% cheaper than the shorter-lived product (Olyset). The trial was limited to only the most widely sold LLINs in Tanzania. Functional survival varies by country, so the single country setting is a limitation. These results suggest that LLIN functional survival is less than 3 years and differs substantially between products, and these differences strongly influence LLIN value for money. LLIN tendering processes should consider local expectations of cost per year of functional life and not unit price. As new LLIN products come on the market, especially those with new insecticides, it will be imperative to monitor their comparative durability to ensure that the most cost-effective products are procured for malaria control.}},

This study assessed how nets are allocated within households to individuals of different age categories as ITNs are lost or damaged and as new ITNs are obtained. The study also explored how ITN allocation affects ITN durability. A cross-sectional household survey and ITN durability study was conducted among 2,875 households across Tanzania to determine the proportion of nets that remain protective (serviceable) 22 months after net distribution aiming for universal coverage. Allocation of study nets within houses, and re-allocation of ITNs when new universal replacement campaign (URC) nets arrived in study households in Musoma District, was also assessed. Some 57.0\% (95\% CI 53.9–60.1\%) of households had sufficient ITNs for every household member, while 84.4\% (95\% CI 82.4–86.4\%) of the population had access to an ITN within their household (assuming 1 net covers every 2 members). In households with sufficient nets, 77.5\% of members slept under ITNs. In households without sufficient nets, pregnant women (54.6\%), children < 5 years (45.8\%) and adults (42.1\%) were prioritized, with fewer school-age children 5–14 years (35.9\%), youths 15–24 years (28.1\%) and seniors > 65 years (32.6\%) sleeping under ITNs. Crowding (≥ 3 people sleeping under nets) was twice as common among people residing in houses without sufficient nets for all age groups, apart from children < 5. Nets were less likely to be serviceable if: ≥ 3 people slept under them (OR 0.50 (95\% CI 0.40–0.63)), or if nets were used by school-age children (OR 0.72 (95\% CI 0.56–0.93)), or if the net product was Olyset®. One month after the URC, only 23.6\% (95\% CI 16.7–30.6\%) of the population had access to a URC ITN in Musoma district. Householders in Musoma district continued the use of old ITNs even with the arrival of new URC nets. Users determined the useful life of ITNs and prioritized pregnant women and children < 5 to serviceable ITNs. When household net access declines, users adjust by crowding under remaining nets, which further reduces ITN lifespan. School-age children that commonly harbour gametocytes that mediate malaria transmission are compelled to sleep under unserviceable nets, crowd under nets or remain uncovered. However, they were accommodated by the arrival of new nets. More frequent ITN delivery through the school net programme in combination with mass distribution campaigns is essential to maximize ITN effectiveness.}},

abstract = {{Abstract Background In Ethiopia, despite improvements in coverage and access, utilization of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) remains a challenge. Different household-level factors have been identified as associated with LLIN use. However, the contribution of LLIN physical integrity to their utilization is not well investigated and documented. This study aimed to assess the association between the physical integrity of LLINs and their use. Methods This study employed a nested case-control design using secondary data from the Ethiopian LLIN durability monitoring study conducted from May 2015 to June 2018. LLINs not used the night before the survey were identified as cases, while those used the previous night were categorized as controls. The physical integrity of LLINs was classified as no holes, good, acceptable, and torn using the proportionate hole index (pHI). A Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) model was used to assess and quantify the association between LLIN physical integrity and use. The model specifications included binomial probabilistic distribution, logit link, exchangeable correlation matrix structure, and robust standard errors. The factors included in the model were selected first by fitting binary regression, and then by including all factors that showed statistical significance at P -value less than 0.25 and conceptually relevant variables into the multivariate regression model. Results A total of 5277 observations fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Out of these 1767 observations were cases while the remaining 3510 were controls. LLINs that were in torn physical condition had higher odds (AOR [95\% CI] = 1.76 [1.41, 2.19]) of not being used compared to LLINs with no holes. Other factors that showed significant association included the age of the LLIN, sleeping place type, washing status of LLINs, perceptions towards net care and repair, LLIN to people ratio, economic status, and study site. Conclusion and recommendation LLINs that have some level of physical damage have a relatively higher likelihood of not being used. Community members need to be educated about proper care and prevention of LLIN damage to delay the development of holes as long as possible and use available LLINs regularly.}},

The purpose of this research is to summarize recent qualitative studies describing LLIN use among the Malagasy people with a focus on children aged 5–15 years. Qualitative data from three studies on malaria conducted between 2012 and 2016 in 10 districts of Madagascar were analysed. These studies cover all malaria epidemiological profiles and 10 of the 18 existing ethnic groups in Madagascar. A thematic analysis was conducted on the collected data from semi-structured interviews, direct observation data, and informal interviews. A total of 192 semi-structured interviews were conducted. LLINs are generally perceived positively because they protect the health and well-being of users. However, regional representations of mosquito nets may contribute to LLIN lower use by children over 5 years of age including the association between married status and LLIN use, which leads to the refusal of unmarried young men to sleep under LLINs; the custom of covering the dead with a mosquito net, which leads to fear of LLIN use; and taboos governing sleeping spaces for siblings of opposite sexes, which leads to LLIN shortages in households. Children under 5 years of age are known to be the most vulnerable age group for acquiring malaria and, therefore, are prioritized for LLIN use when there are limited supplies in households. In contrast, children over 5 years of age, who are perceived to be at less risk for malaria, often sleep without LLINs. Perceptions, social practices and regional beliefs regarding LLINs and vulnerability to malaria contribute to the nonuse of LLINs among children over 5 years of age in Madagascar. Modifying LLIN policies to account for these factors may increase LLIN use in this age group and reduce disease burden.}},

This article situates the notion of compliance with ‘bednet use’ within everyday practices in an area of south-west Burkina Faso with high malaria transmission. By drawing on ethnographic fieldwork conducted between 2017 and 2018, it critically describes the precarious micro-environments that foreground bednet use—from gender and age to the means of (re)production of social and labour conditions—and assesses the bednets’ effectiveness and community uptake. Bednet use stems from concrete, ordinary dynamics that interweave only apparently at the margins of the time individuals most need to be protected by a net. This work conceptualises ‘compliance’ beyond binary indicators of intervention uptake and locates ‘use’ as the result of contingent assemblages.}},

abstract = {{ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: During the past decade the malaria control community has been successful in dramatically increasing the number of households that own mosquito nets. However, as many as half of nets already in households go unused. This study examines the factors associated with use of nets owned in Ghana. METHODS: The data come from an August 2008 survey in Ghana of households with a pregnant woman or a guardian of a child under five, conducted during the rainy season. 1796 households were included in this analysis, which generated a sample of 1,852 mosquito nets. Using each net owned as the unit of analysis, multivariate logistic regression was used to examine the relationship of net used last night with 23 potentially explanatory variables having to do with characteristics of the household, of the respondent, and of the net. Odds Ratios, p-values, and confidence intervals were calculated for each variable to develop an explanatory model. RESULTS: The final multivariate model consisted of 10 variables statistically associated with whether or not the net was used the prior night: rural location, lower SES, not using coils for mosquito control, fewer nets in the household, newer nets and those in better condition, light blue colour, higher level of education of the guardian of the child under five, knowing that mosquitoes transmit malaria, and paying for the net instead of obtaining it free of charge. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that net use would increase in Ghana if coloured nets were made available in mass distributions as well as in the commercial market; if programmes emphasize that malaria is caused only by night-biting mosquitoes, and that nets protect against mosquitoes better than coils and need to be used even if coils are burning; if donated nets are replaced more frequently so that households have nets that are in good condition; and if there were support for the commercial market so that those who can afford to purchase a net and want to choose their own nets can do so.}},

A small-scale exploratory study was conducted in several locations in the Niger Delta region, Nigeria, to discover barriers against the use of bed nets, in the context of a current drive to scale up net use in Nigeria. METHODS: A qualitative approach with a convenience sample was used. One to one interviews with mostly male adult volunteers were undertaken which explored typical living and sleeping arrangements, and perceptions about and barriers against the use of the mosquito prevention bed net. RESULTS: Several key issues emerged from the qualitative data. Bed nets were not reported as widely used in this small sample. The reasons reported for lack of use included issues of convenience, especially net set up and dismantling; potential hazard and safety concerns; issues related to typical family composition and nature of accommodation; humid weather conditions; and perceptions of cost and effectiveness. Most barriers to net use concerned issues about everyday practical living and sleeping arrangements and perceptions about comfort. Interviewees identified were aware of malaria infection risks, but several also indicated certain beliefs that were barriers to net use. CONCLUSIONS: Successful control of malaria and scale up of insecticide-treated net coverage relies on community perceptions and practice. This small study has illuminated a number of important everyday life issues, which remain barriers to sustained net use, and has clarified further questions to be considered in net design and in future research studies. The study highlights the need for further research on the human concerns that contribute to sustained use of nets or, conversely, present significant barriers to their use}},

Countries adopting the 'universal access' policy include Zambia. Policy implementation in many settings involves mass distribution of free ITNs to achieve a measure of universal coverage. This study examines ITN deployment and use in the context of mass distribution efforts towards achieving universal coverage in a malaria-endemic district in Zambia. We use multiple logistic regression to identify predictors of ITN deployment and use by anyone in the household and by children under five. Among ITN-owning households with a child under five, 69\% used at least one ITN the night before the survey. About half of those children (54\%) in ITN-owning households were covered the previous night. A strong and consistent predictor of use is household deployment of at least one ITN. Just over half of all ITNs were observed hanging, and reported use of nets for purposes other than malaria prevention was only 3\%. Net characteristics, including shape, colour and whether or not the ITN was purchased, were not associated with net deployment. However, ITNs in poor condition are more likely to be observed hanging than ITNs in new or good condition. In the context of free mass distribution of ITNs, behaviour change communication and activities are necessary to improve use. Results suggest campaigns and messages that persuade recipients to hang up their ITNs would contribute towards closing the gap between ownership and use.}},

Mass distribution has greatly expanded LLIN access in sub-Saharan Africa, but a gap remains between LLIN ownership and use. Furthermore, LLINs wear out more quickly than anticipated. This paper suggests a participatory research strategy-trials of improved practices (TIPs)-that could identify locally appropriate approaches to prolonging net life and increasing effective use. We used TIPs to overcome barriers to optimal net use in the Peruvian Amazon. Working with 15 families in three villages, we tested home treatment of cotton nets, use of an alternative netting fabric, and alternative washing and care instructions. TIPs helped confirm feasibility of these interventions. Although our findings are time- and context-specific, TIPs could help improve consistency and effectiveness of current LLIN use and prolong net lifespan in sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere. This would help maximize the value of shrinking donor resources for malaria.}},

abstract = {{Malaria infection accounts for over one million deaths worldwide annually. India has the highest number of malaria deaths outside Africa, with half among Indian tribal communities. Our study sought to identify barriers to malaria control within tribal populations in malaria-endemic Gadchiroli district, Maharashtra. This qualitative study was conducted via focus groups and interviews with 84 participants, and included tribal villagers, traditional healers, community health workers (CHWs), medical officers, and district officials. Questions assessed knowledge about malaria, behavior during early stages of infection, and experiences with prevention among tribal villagers and traditional healers. CHWs, medical officers, and district officials were asked about barriers to treating and preventing malaria among tribal populations. Data were inductively analyzed and assembled into broader explanation linking barriers to geographical, cultural and social factors. Findings indicate lack of knowledge regarding malaria symptoms and transmission. Fever cases initially present to traditional healers or informal providers who have little knowledge of malaria or high-risk groups such as children and pregnant women. Tribal adherence with antimalarial medications is poor. Malaria prevention is inadequate, with low-density and inconsistent use of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs). Malaria educational materials are culturally inappropriate, relying on dominant language literacy. Remote villages and lack of transport complicate surveillance by CHWs. Costs of treating malaria outside the village are high. Geographic, cultural, and social factors create barriers to malaria control among tribal communities in India. Efforts to decrease malaria burden among these populations must consider such realities. Our results suggest improving community-level knowledge about malaria using culturally-appropriate health education materials; making traditional healers partners in malaria control; promoting within-village rapid diagnosis and treatment; increasing ITN distribution and promoting their use as potential strategies to decrease infection rates in these communities. These insights may be used to shape malaria control programs among marginalized populations.}},

Methods: This was a mixed cross sectional descriptive study that used data from household representatives and interviews with malaria control officers in three randomly selected districts of the region. Results: The study identified that apart from sleeping under the ITN and using it as window curtains and provision of warmth during cold weathers, the ITN is put in to other uses like nursing of seedlings, protecting chickens, fishing and fencing of animal pens. Major barriers to sustained use of the ITN included over complacency and the influence of male dominance. Cost of ITN, room shape and size, design of the ITN were identified as minor barriers to the use of the ITN.   Conclusions: Health care practitioners, social environmental officers and preventive health care services providers should use behavior change communication methods in curtailing most of these barriers to the sustainable use of the ITN.}},

abstract = {{Introduction: Universally, malaria continues to ravage the lives of innocent expectant women. In Kenya malaria prevalence among adult females is 28\% while in Mt. Elgon Sub County, which is categorised under highland epidemic prone malaria area, prevalence of malaria in pregnancy (MiP) is uncertain. Therefore, this study sought to determine intriguing predictors associated with malaria infection among pregnant women in Mt. Elgon Sub-County.
 Methods: Cross-sectional analytical design was employed and mixed methods used for data collection. For quantitative data collection, semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect primary data from pregnant women who attended ANC in selected health facilities in the study area. Further, qualitative approach adopted interview guides that targeted key informants in the health facilities. Systematic random sampling method was used to select 392 participants for the study. Data was analysed by SPSS version 25.0.  Bivariate logistic regression analysis was used to test the association between independent variable and dependent variable.
 Findings:  Study results revealed that, the prevalence of MiP was 16.2\%. Prevalence was higher among women aged less than 25 (67.3\%, n=262) compared to those aged > 25 years (33.7\%, n=137). The following five factors were statistically significantly associated with malaria prevalence in pregnancy: place of residence (OR: 5.7; 95\%CI: 2.6 – 12.4; p < 0.0001); those who tested positive in the last 2 years (OR: 1.7; 95\%CI: 1.0 – 2.9; p = 0.05); preferred shape of ITN’s (OR: 3.8; 95\%CI: 1.5 – 9.7; p = 0.008);earth floor (OR: 1.8; 95\%CI: 1.0 – 3.1; p = 0.03);  mud wall (OR: 1.8; 95\%CI: 1.0 – 3.1; p = 0.03). In conclusion, age group, place of residence, testing positive in the last 2 years, preferred shape of ITN, earth floor and mud wall were significant factors associated with MiP.
 Recommendations: To curb MiP, the study recommends Bungoma County government to promote use of ITNs and preferable rectangular ITN’s by ensuring they are translated to appropriate use; support regular indoor residual spraying with insecticides and educate the residents on the role of improved housing on malaria protection and empowerment of the community to adopt improved housing.}},

This paper explores the socioeconomic and demographic determinants of ITN ownership and use among Ghanaian families. Data on 5741 households were obtained from the 2019 Ghana Malaria Indicator Survey. The survey is a nationally representative survey that obtains data on malaria‐related issues. Negative binomial and Tobit regressions were applied to achieve the study’s objectives. Residence (rural‐urban), wealth, and administrative region emerged as the most important predictors of ITN ownership and usage in Ghana. The results favoured rural and non‐Greater Accra residents. However, wealth had a contrasting association with ITN ownership and use. Whereas affluent households owned more ITNs than the extremely poor, the latter used them more. Also, age and household size were significant for ITN ownership. Both variables had a nonlinear (inverted U‐shaped) relationship with ITN ownership. In contrast, the proportion of household members under 5 and the bed net‐to‐household size ratio were positive and statistically significant determinants of ITN use. The study highlights the need to effectively target the poor, especially in rural areas, for ITNs under the NMCP instead of universal distribution.}},

To examine spatial variation in South-West region of Nigeria, this study examines level of utilization among under-five children in the region. Data from the 2018 Nigeria Demographic Health Survey is used to examine relationships between different covariates and spatial variation using a semi-parametric model. Gaussian, Poisson and Zero Inflated Poisson distributions were assumed for the response variable and comparisons were made. The Deviance Information Criteria (DIC) is used as selection criteria. With lowest DIC among the competing distributions, Gaussian has the best fit for the model. Spatial variation is observed in the utilization across states. Ondo state has highest net usage among children follow by Ogun state. Both Lagos and Ekiti states have the least. Higher utilizations are observed among rural residents and households without some basic amenities and mass media. Utilization is found to be higher among respondents in the poor category of wealth index. Educational status of mothers is found to affect ITNs utilization. Non-linear effect of age of the children on the number of children sleeping under net has a bathtub shape, indicating decrease in number of children sleeping under net as age increases till around two years and then starts increasing. For effective utilization of ITNs, more efforts are to be put into campaigns on the importance of utilization rather than only ownership.}},

This study synthesizes the factors associated with using the ITN as a malaria prevention tool in sub-Saharan Africa. There was an advanced search of four electronic databases, including PubMed Central, CINAHL, EMBASE, and Google Scholar, and identified articles between 2016 to April 2021. Following the title, abstract and full-text reading, 13 articles were deemed appropriate for this review. All the researchers developed, discussed, and accepted a matrix to extract relevant information from the studies. A convergent synthesis was adopted and allowed for integrating qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-method studies and transforming them into qualitative findings. Household and caregiver related factors that influenced utilization of the ITN were, Household heads having two or more sleeping places, a knowledge that ITN prevents malaria, the presence of hanging ITNs, high literacy, living female-headed households, birth spacing, unmarried mothers, and antenatal clinic attendance promoted utilization. Perceived malaria risk was a critical determinant of ITN ownership and utilization. Some factors that hindered the use of the ITN included hotness of the weather, absence of visible mosquitoes, cost, inadequate number, rooms designs, unaffordability, insufficient knowledge on causes of malaria, and poor attitude to use. Specific ITN factors that hindered use were color, chemicals use, odor, and shape. It is important to use integrated multi-sectoral and culturally appropriate interventions to encourage households to prioritize and utilize the ITN in under-5 children.}},
